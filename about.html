                This visualization displays a map of California Counties
                three matrices corresponding to amount of Harvest Acres,
                Yield (Unit/Acre), and average price from year 1980 to 2020.
                This visualization will allow you to explore different wine
                regions and differentiate how price and yield compare.

                First click on the matrix data you want to see. By hovering over
                each block (which indicates a year) of data, the designated county
                is highlighted on the map, while also providing specifics of that
                county at the bottom of the page.

                Hovering over a county on the map highlights the area. When
                clicking on county, the matrix is highlighted with the county
                name.
                Simply move the mouse off of the data you want to reset everything.
